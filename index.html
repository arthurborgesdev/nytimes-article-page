          Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize 
          the existence of inflation, which explains how the universe 
          expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after 
          the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young 
        physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment 
        at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing 
        far beyond the world of known physics.

        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
        particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he 
        discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A 
        potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have 
        infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, 
        causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a 
        prodigiously violent instant.
